Possibility Distribution

In mathematics and statistics, the probability distribution (which must be mathematically described by the probability distribution function), sets probability for each interval in such a way that the axioms of probabilities are fulfilled. In mathematical language, the probability distribution function is a probabilistic degree defined on the Borel algebra of intervals.
The distribution of probabilities is a special case of a more general definition of the probabilistic measure, which is a function that corresponds to measurable sets of dimensional probability space under the Kolmogorov axioms.
